# MGS Bedrock Cross-Section Tools

This repository contains ArcGIS toolboxes of Python 3 geoprocessing tools for setting up cross section data. The data are set up in a "traditional" display, which plots the westernmost end of the cross section at an x coordinate of zero. Vertical exaggeration is created by compressing the x axis, and the y coordinate shows the data elevation in feet. "Measure on line" is used to plot data appropriately along the cross section line. This display works for cross sections in any orientation.

Some documentation, sample data, and layer files for the tools can be found in this repository. All scripts and associated files are currently under construction.
